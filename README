This is a animation project written with VS2017. It is able to import Skeletons, skins, and animations, then play the animation. 

To run, simply open the solution and run. By the time command window shows up, hit Enter the play the default animation of a walking wasp.

When the command window shows up you can enter filenames like:
something.skel something.skin something.anim

First is skeleton file, second is skin file, last is animation file

You can only input skeleton file and skin file, then no animation will be played.

I provided wasp.skel wasp.skin wasp.anim for test, and these are the files run by default.

I also provided tube.skel and tube.skin. No anim file for this model.

When the model is rendering, you can press 's' to turn on/off the skin, and you can use left mouse key to turn the camera and right mouse key to change the distance between camera and center of the scene.

An example of walking wasp is uploaded to the media section.

This project has start code, so not all files are implemented by myself, classes implemented by me are:
DOF Joint Skeleton Skin Vertex Pose Keyframe Triangle AnimationClip

I also modified Tester class to run my code.
